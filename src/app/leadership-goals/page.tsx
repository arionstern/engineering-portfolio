      <h2>Leadership & Collaboration</h2>
      <p>
        I value leadership that is grounded in technical competence, clear
        communication, and accountability. In team settings, I focus on
        understanding system-level goals, breaking problems into actionable
        tasks, and supporting teammates through both technical and organizational
        challenges.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Experience working in collaborative engineering environments where
          design decisions must balance performance, complexity, and deadlines
        </li>
        <li>
          Comfortable taking ownership of technically challenging components
          while coordinating closely with teammates
        </li>
        <li>
          Emphasis on documentation, reproducibility, and clear explanation of
          design choices
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Professional Interests</h2>
      <p>
        My primary interests are in embedded systems, low-level software, and
        performance-aware design. I enjoy working close to the hardware–software
        boundary, where architectural decisions have measurable real-world
        impact.
      </p>
